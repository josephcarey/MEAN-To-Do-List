### Tasks

## Assignment

# Base
- [x] use angular
- [x] create and store a task, refresh tasks
- [x] task have complete, delete options
- [x] change styling based on whether or not task is complete (check 'ng- [ ]class')
- [x] store task complete in the database
- [x] deleting should remove from table and database
- [ ] change background color, font family/size
# Stretch
- [x] add Bootstrap
- [ ] create an 'are you sure yes/no' thing when deleting a task
- [ ] Add a category field for the task; allow users to filter by task category
- [ ] adjust the logic so that completed tasks move down and others move up

# My Ideas

- [ ] use Sweet Alert?
- [ ] can we scrap app.use( bodyParser.urlencoded( { extended: true } ) ); from server.js? Is it just for jQuery?
- [ ] clearing the inputs: we could use a for...in loop instead, but that's kinda scary.
- [ ] spin all of the client-side connection logic out into its own object

# Questions
- [ ] do we have to stick to one giant js file on the client side?
- [ ] questions around spinning out the client-side connection logic (promises, other js files)

# To Do
- [ ] Pop up works
- [ ] Pop up confirm delete works
- [ ] Pop up edit works
- [ ] filter by category

# Stretch
- [ ] Initialized to dos if blank
- [ ] Color scheme
- [ ] Font
- [ ] Sidebar
