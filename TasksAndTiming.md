### Tasks

## Assignment

# Base
- [x] use angular
- [x] create and store a task, refresh tasks
- [ ] task have complete, delete options
- [ ] change styling based on whether or not task is complete (check 'ng- [ ]class')
- [x] store task complete in the database
- [ ] deleting should remove from table and database
- [ ] change background color, font family/size
# Stretch
- [x] add Bootstrap
- [ ] create an 'are you sure yes/no' thing when deleting a task
- [ ] Add a category field for the task; allow users to filter by task category
- [ ] adjust the logic so that completed tasks move down and others move up

# My Ideas

- [ ] use Sweet Alert?
- [ ] can we scrap app.use( bodyParser.urlencoded( { extended: true } ) ); from server.js? Is it just for jQuery?
- [ ] clearing the inputs: we could use a for...in loop instead, but that's kinda scary.

# Questions
- [ ] do we have to stick to one giant js file on the client side?
